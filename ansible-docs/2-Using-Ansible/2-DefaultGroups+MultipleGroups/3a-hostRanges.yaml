# You can specify a stride (step)(increments between sequence numbers) when defining a numeric range of hosts:
# The example above would make the subdomains www01, www03, www05, â€¦, www49 match, but not www00, www02, www50 and so on, because the stride (increment) is 2 units each step.
# For numeric patterns, leading zeros can be included or removed, as desired. Ranges are inclusive. You can also define alphabetic ranges:
