****** Grouping groups: parent/child group relationships ******
# You can create parent/child relationships among groups. Parent groups are also known as nested groups or groups of groups. 
# For example, if all your production hosts are already in groups such as atlanta_prod and denver_prod, you can create a production group that includes those smaller groups. 
# This approach reduces maintenance because you can add or remove hosts from the parent group by editing the child groups.

# To create parent/child relationships for groups:

# - In INI format, use the :children suffix

# - In YAML format, use the children: entry

# Here is the same inventory as shown above, simplified with parent groups for the prod and test groups. 
# The two inventory files give you the same results:    


# Child groups have a couple of properties to note:

# - Any host that is a member of a child group is automatically a member of the parent group.

# - Groups can have multiple parents and children, but not circular relationships.

# - Hosts can also be in multiple groups, but there will only be one instance of a host at runtime. Ansible merges the data from multiple groups.

<!--NOTE THAT THIS FILES ARE BASICALLY FOR NOTE TAKING. NO commands was ran as the host do not exist-->

# Sample YAML below:

ungrouped:
  hosts:
    mail.example.com:
webservers:
  hosts:
    foo.example.com:
    bar.example.com:
dbservers:
  hosts:
    one.example.com:
    two.example.com:
    three.example.com:
east:
  hosts:
    foo.example.com:
    one.example.com:
    two.example.com:
west:
  hosts:
    bar.example.com:
    three.example.com:
prod:
  children:
    east:
test:
  children:
    west:
