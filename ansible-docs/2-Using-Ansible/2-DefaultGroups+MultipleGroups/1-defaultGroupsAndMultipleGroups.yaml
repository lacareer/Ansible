****** Default groups ******
# Even if you do not define any groups in your inventory file, Ansible creates two default groups: all and ungrouped. 
# The all group contains every host. The ungrouped group contains all hosts that donâ€™t have another group aside from all. 
# Every host will always belong to at least 2 groups (all and ungrouped or all and some other group). 
# For example, in the basic inventory above, the host mail.example.com belongs to the all group and the ungrouped group; the host two.example.com belongs to the all group and the dbservers group. Though all and ungrouped are always present, they can be implicit and not appear in group listings like group_names.

****** Hosts in multiple groups ******
# You can put each host in more than one group. For example, a production web server in a data center in Atlanta might be included in groups called [prod] and [atlanta] and [webservers]. 
# You can create groups that track:

# - What - An application, stack or microservice (for example, database servers, web servers, and so on).

# - Where - A datacenter or region, to talk to local DNS, storage, and so on (for example, east, west).

# - When - The development stage, to avoid testing on production resources (for example, prod, test).

# Extending the previous YAML inventory to include what, when, and where would look like this:
