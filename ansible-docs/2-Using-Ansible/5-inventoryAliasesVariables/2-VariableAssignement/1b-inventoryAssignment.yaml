# You can store variable values that relate to a specific host or group in inventory. 
# To start with, you may add variables directly to the hosts and groups in your main inventory file.

# We document adding variables in the main inventory file for simplicity. However, storing variables in separate host and group variable files is a more robust approach to describing your system policy. 
# Setting variables in the main inventory file is only a shorthand. See Organizing host and group (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#splitting-out-vars) variables for guidelines on storing variable values in individual files in the ‘host_vars’ directory. 
# See Organizing host and group variables for details.
